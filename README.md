# Noughts-and-crosses-game
a noughts and crosses game i made to learn about GUI building and the minimax algorithm, credit to "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/finding-optimal-move-in-tic-tac-toe-using-minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory/" for the algorithm

Put all 4 files into a compiler (I used VScode), and run template, which references the other
files (the 2 pictures are sprites) and the minimax is the working algorithm, responsible
for the actions of the computer.
